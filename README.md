EduGenie SRMIST — AI Attendance & Quiz Bot (Prototype)
A lightweight classroom assistant that marks attendance, runs a quick quiz with a yes/no continue flow, and captures feedback, all in a simple web UI.

Pitch: Ditch spreadsheets and manual roll-calls. One page, a few clicks, done.

🧩 Problem Statement
In fast‑paced classes, taking attendance eats time and breaks momentum. Teachers also need a quick pulse on understanding without preparing separate tools. Switching between apps (attendance sheet, quiz app, feedback form) costs time and focus.

Goal: Build a single, minimal tool that lets a teacher mark attendance quickly, ask short quizzes for engagement, and log feedback—with zero setup and local‑only data storage.

🚦 Current Progress Status
✅ Core features complete:
Add students
Mark attendance for today (present/absent auto‑computed)
Show today’s attendance stats
Start quiz → answer → “Do you want another question? (yes/no)” appears only after each quiz question
Save free‑text feedback
Simple frontend with buttons & chat area
🔜 Nice‑to‑have / pending:
Per‑student quiz history & CSV export
Question bank management (CRUD)
Authentication / roles
Mobile polish & richer chat bubbles
Error toasts and validation in frontend
💡 How the Prototype Solves It
One screen for all actions (attendance, quiz, feedback).
Local database (SQLite) ensures privacy and zero-dependency deployment.
Clear state separation: attendance flow doesn’t leak “yes/no”; quiz is the only place that uses yes/no continuation.
Stateless frontend + simple REST makes it easy to extend later (React, Next.js, etc.).
🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask, Flask‑CORS, SQLite3
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS (Fetch API), Font Awesome
Data: SQLite file classroom.db
No external AI model — deterministic, rule‑based logic for reliability in demos

⚙️ Setup & Run (Local)
Prereqs: Python 3.10+

# 1) Clone and enter
git clone Kunal1703.git
cd C:\Users\kunal\Downloads\peroject\ruchuuu>

# 2) (Recommended) Create & activate a virtual env
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
# source venv/bin/activate

# 3) Install deps
pip install flask flask-cors

# 4) Run backend (http://127.0.0.1:5000)
python app.py
Serve the frontend
Option A — open index.html directly in your browser
Option B — run a static server (prevents some CORS quirks):

# In the project root (serves at http://127.0.0.1:5500)
python -m http.server 5500
Then open: http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html

Note: The frontend expects the backend at http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat. If you change ports, update the fetch URL in index.html.

🧪 Using the App (Happy Path)
Add students
In the chat, type:
add students Alice, Bob, Charlie

Mark attendance
Click Mark Attendance → the bot asks for a comma‑separated list of present students.
Example reply: Alice, Charlie
(Absent are auto‑computed.)

Start quiz
Click Start Quiz → you’ll see a question.

Answer it (e.g., 6) → bot checks and then asks:
Do you want another question? (yes/no)
Reply yes for the next question, no to finish (score shown).
Only the quiz uses this yes/no prompt.
Attendance stats
Click Stats to view today’s students counts.

Feedback
Click Feedback → type your message → it’s saved locally.

🔌 API (for reference)
POST /chat
{ "message": "start quiz" }
Response

{ "response": "Here is a quiz question: ..." }
GET /students
Returns all student names.

GET /feedback
Returns saved feedback entries.

GET /attendance/<YYYY-MM-DD>
Returns attendance records for the given date.

🗃️ Data Model (SQLite)
students: id (PK), name (UNIQUE)
attendance: id (PK), date, student_id (FK), status ('present'|'absent')
feedback: id (PK), text, timestamp
🖼️ Screenshots (Add before submission)
Put images in ./screenshots/ and keep file names short.
